## Use Case 1: Startup MVP Authentication
### **Launch Your SaaS in Days, Not Months**

**The Challenge:**
Building authentication from scratch is expensive, time-consuming, and risky. Most startups spend 2-4 weeks building password systems, only to discover security vulnerabilities later. By the time you realize you need OAuth, JWT tokens, and rate limiting, you've already burned through your runway.

**The Solution:**
Our free-tier OTP Auth API gives you enterprise-grade passwordless authentication in under 10 minutes. No infrastructure, no servers, no security headaches—just a simple REST API that works with React, Svelte, Vue, or any framework.

**Why It Matters:**
- **Time to Market:** Ship your MVP 3-4 weeks faster
- **Zero Infrastructure:** No servers, databases, or DevOps overhead
- **Built-in Security:** Cryptographically secure OTP codes, JWT tokens, rate limiting, and audit logging
- **Global Scale:** Cloudflare edge network means sub-100ms response times worldwide
- **Free to Start:** No credit card required. Perfect for validating your idea before scaling

**Perfect For:**
- SaaS startups validating product-market fit
- Indie developers building side projects
- Agencies building client applications
- Teams that need authentication yesterday

**Key Features:**
- [SUCCESS] 3 OTP requests per email/hour (perfect for MVPs)
- [SUCCESS] 10-minute OTP expiration
- [SUCCESS] 7-hour JWT token sessions
- [SUCCESS] Works with any framework
- [SUCCESS] GDPR compliant out of the box

## Use Case 2: Enterprise Security Without Enterprise Costs
### **Passwordless Authentication That Scales**

**The Challenge:**
Your business is growing, but your authentication system isn't. Password reset flows are breaking, users are complaining about login complexity, and security audits are flagging vulnerabilities. Enterprise auth solutions cost $500-2000/month, but you're not ready for that commitment.

**The Solution:**
Our OTP Auth API provides enterprise-grade security features at startup-friendly prices. Multi-tenant ready, with complete customer isolation, per-tenant rate limiting, and comprehensive audit logging—all on a free tier that scales with your business.

**Why It Matters:**
- **Eliminate Password Breaches:** No passwords = no password leaks, credential stuffing, or brute force attacks
- **Reduce Support Costs:** Users can't forget passwords they never had. Support tickets drop by 60-80%
- **Compliance Ready:** GDPR-compliant data export/deletion, 90-day audit logs, and security event tracking
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Built for SaaS from day one. Complete customer isolation with API key management
- **Cost Effective:** Free tier for development/testing. Pay only when you scale

**Perfect For:**
- B2B SaaS companies with multiple customers
- Healthcare/FinTech apps requiring audit trails
- E-commerce platforms reducing cart abandonment
- Teams migrating from legacy password systems

**Key Features:**
- [SUCCESS] Multi-tenant customer isolation
- [SUCCESS] Per-tenant rate limiting and configuration
- [SUCCESS] 90-day audit log retention
- [SUCCESS] API key management for enterprise
- [SUCCESS] Custom email templates and providers
- [SUCCESS] IP allowlisting and CORS policies

## Use Case 3: Developer Experience That Doesn't Suck
### **The Auth API Developers Actually Want to Use**

**The Challenge:**
Most authentication APIs are overcomplicated, poorly documented, or require 47 dependencies just to get started. Your developers are spending more time fighting with auth libraries than building features. Documentation is outdated, examples don't work, and support tickets go unanswered.

**The Solution:**
Our OTP Auth API is built by developers, for developers. Simple REST endpoints, clear documentation, working code examples in React/Svelte/Vanilla JS, and an interactive Swagger UI. No SDKs required—just HTTP requests that work the first time.

**Why It Matters:**
- **5-Minute Integration:** Copy-paste our code examples and you're done
- **Framework Agnostic:** Works with React, Svelte, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript
- **Standards Compliant:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, RFC 7807 error format
- **Interactive Docs:** Swagger UI lets you test endpoints without leaving your browser
- **Real Code Examples:** Not pseudocode—actual, working examples you can use immediately

**Perfect For:**
- Development teams tired of broken auth libraries
- Agencies building multiple client projects
- Solo developers who value their time
- Teams that need working code, not marketing fluff

**Key Features:**
- [SUCCESS] Simple REST API (no SDKs required)
- [SUCCESS] Working code examples in 3+ frameworks
- [SUCCESS] Interactive Swagger UI documentation
- [SUCCESS] RFC 7807 compliant error responses
- [SUCCESS] OAuth 2.0 / OIDC compatible
