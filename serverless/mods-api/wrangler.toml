# KV Namespaces and R2 buckets are now defined per environment below
# Default bindings (for backward compatibility) are in [env.production] section

# Environment variables (secrets should be set via wrangler secret put)
# DO NOT put actual secrets here - use wrangler CLI:
#   wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET          # REQUIRED: JWT signing secret (must match OTP auth service)
#   wrangler secret put ALLOWED_EMAILS      # REQUIRED: Comma-separated list of allowed email addresses for upload/management
#   wrangler secret put ALLOWED_ORIGINS     # OPTIONAL: Comma-separated CORS origins (recommended for production)
#   wrangler secret put MODS_PUBLIC_URL     # OPTIONAL: Public URL for R2 bucket (if using custom domain)
#
# IMPORTANT: 
#   - JWT_SECRET must match the OTP auth service secret for authentication to work
#   - ALLOWED_EMAILS restricts who can upload/manage mods (leave unset to allow all authenticated users)
