# KV Namespace is now defined per environment below
# Default binding (for backward compatibility) is in [env.production] section

# Environment variables (secrets should be set via wrangler secret put)
# DO NOT put actual secrets here - use wrangler CLI:
#   wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET          # REQUIRED: JWT signing secret (use: openssl rand -hex 32)
#   wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY       # REQUIRED: Resend API key from https://resend.com/api-keys
#   wrangler secret put RESEND_FROM_EMAIL    # REQUIRED: Verified email address (e.g., noreply@yourdomain.com)
#   wrangler secret put ALLOWED_ORIGINS      # OPTIONAL: Comma-separated CORS origins (recommended for production)
#
# IMPORTANT: The service will fail health checks if required secrets are missing.
# Check secrets: wrangler secret list
# Verify health: curl https://otp-auth-service.strixuns-script-suite.workers.dev/health/ready

# Alternative: Configure in Cloudflare Dashboard (recommended for production):
# 1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ΓåÆ Workers & Pages ΓåÆ otp-auth-service
# 2. Go to Settings ΓåÆ Triggers ΓåÆ Routes
# 3. Add custom domain route: auth.idling.app/*
# 4. DNS records are automatically managed by Cloudflare
#
# Note: Routes configured in the dashboard take precedence over wrangler.toml
