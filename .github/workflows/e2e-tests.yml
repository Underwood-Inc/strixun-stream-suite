# Strixun Stream Suite - E2E Tests Workflow
#
# This workflow runs end-to-end tests against LOCAL Cloudflare Workers (wrangler dev).
# All workers run locally on the CI runner - no deployment required.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Wrangler CLI must be available (installed via pnpm)
#   - Test secrets are automatically generated via setup:test-secrets scripts
#   - Local workers start automatically via playwright.config.ts webServer config
