# VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY Audit Report
**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: ✓ CONFIRMED - Service Key Encryption Removed

## Executive Summary

**You are correct!** `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` was removed and replaced with JWT-based encryption. The audit confirms:

- ✓ Service key encryption is **DEPRECATED** and returns `undefined`
- ✓ All encryption now uses **JWT tokens** via `encryptWithJWT` / `decryptWithJWT`
- ✓ `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is **NOT required** for frontend apps
- ⚠ Some documentation and type definitions still reference it (outdated)

---

## 🔍 Code Evidence

### 1. Shared Config - DEPRECATED

**File**: `shared-config/otp-encryption.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * DEPRECATED: Service Key Encryption Removed
 * 
 * Service key encryption has been removed from the codebase.
 * It was obfuscation only (key is in frontend bundle), not real security.
 * 
 * This file is kept for backward compatibility but the function returns undefined.
 * All callers should be updated to not use service key encryption.
 * 
 * @deprecated Service key encryption removed - returns undefined
 */
export function getOtpEncryptionKey(): undefined {
  console.warn('[DEPRECATED] getOtpEncryptionKey() - Service key encryption removed. HTTPS provides transport security.');
  return undefined;
}
```

**Status**: ✓ Function exists but returns `undefined` - deprecated

---

### 2. API Framework - JWT Only

**File**: `packages/api-framework/encryption/index.ts`

The API framework **only exports JWT-based encryption**:
- ✓ `encryptWithJWT` - JWT token-based encryption
- ✓ `decryptWithJWT` - JWT token-based decryption
- ✓ `encryptBinaryWithJWT` - Binary JWT encryption
- ✓ `decryptBinaryWithJWT` - Binary JWT decryption
- ✗ **NO service key functions** (`encryptWithServiceKey` removed)

**Status**: ✓ Only JWT encryption available

---

### 3. Build System Documentation

**File**: `packages/api-framework/encryption/BUILD_SYSTEM.md`

```markdown
### Removed: VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY

**⚠ IMPORTANT**: `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` has been **completely removed** from the build system.

- **Service key encryption was removed**: The `encryptWithServiceKey()` function has been removed from `@strixun/api-framework`
- **JWT encryption only**: All encryption now uses JWT tokens via the API framework
- **No build-time key required**: The `otp-auth-service` dashboard build no longer requires `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
```

**Status**: ✓ Officially documented as removed

---

### 4. Frontend Type Definitions

#### Root App (`src/vite-env.d.ts`)
```typescript
readonly VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY?: string; // CRITICAL: OTP encryption key...
```
**Status**: ⚠ **OUTDATED** - Still references it but not used

#### Mods Hub (`mods-hub/src/vite-env.d.ts`)
```typescript
// VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY removed - service key encryption was obfuscation only
```
**Status**: ✓ **CORRECT** - Explicitly removed

---

### 5. Backend Handler - Legacy Check Only

**File**: `serverless/otp-auth-service/handlers/auth/verify-otp.ts`

```typescript
// Check if body is encrypted (has encrypted: true and data field)
if (body.encrypted === true && body.data && typeof body.data === 'string') {
    // Try to decrypt using API framework if service key is available
    if (env.SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY && env.SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY.length >= 32) {
        try {
            const { decryptWithJWT } = await import('@strixun/api-framework');
            const decrypted = await decryptWithJWT(body, env.SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY);
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

**Status**: ⚠ **LEGACY CODE** - Still checks for `SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` but uses `decryptWithJWT` (JWT-based). This is likely backward compatibility code that should be removed.

**Note**: The function name is `decryptWithJWT` but it's being passed `SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - this seems like a bug or legacy code path.

## ✓ Current Encryption System

### JWT-Based Encryption (Current)

All encryption now uses **JWT tokens**:

1. **Client-side**: Encrypts with user's JWT token
   ```typescript
   import { encryptWithJWT } from '@strixun/api-framework';
   const encrypted = await encryptWithJWT(data, jwtToken);
   ```

2. **Server-side**: Decrypts with same JWT token
   ```typescript
   import { decryptWithJWT } from '@strixun/api-framework';
   const decrypted = await decryptWithJWT(encrypted, jwtToken);
   ```

3. **No service key needed**: Encryption is per-user, per-session

## 📋 Files That Still Reference VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY

### Outdated Documentation (Should be Updated)

1. `ENVIRONMENT_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Lists `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as required
2. `shared-config/README.md` - References service key encryption
3. `mods-hub/ENCRYPTION_KEY_SETUP.md` - Outdated setup guide
4. `serverless/otp-auth-service/SETUP_LOCAL_DEV.md` - May reference it
5. Various deployment guides in `╠═══════ PANDA_CORE ═══════╣` directory

### Outdated Type Definitions (Should be Cleaned)

1. `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Still has `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` type definition

### Legacy Scripts (Not Used)

1. `serverless/set-all-encryption-keys.ps1` - Sets `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
2. `serverless/set-service-encryption-key.sh` - Sets `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
3. `serverless/otp-auth-service/scripts/build-with-key.js` - Legacy build script

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✓ **Remove from ENVIRONMENT_AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Update to reflect JWT-only encryption
2. ✓ **Update `src/vite-env.d.ts`** - Remove `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` type definition
3. ✓ **Clean up legacy handler code** - Remove `SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` check in `verify-otp.ts`
4. ⚠ **Mark legacy scripts as deprecated** - Add deprecation notices

### Documentation Updates Needed

1. Update all setup guides to remove `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` references
2. Update deployment workflows documentation
3. Update `shared-config/README.md` to reflect JWT-only approach

## ✓ Verification

- [x] `getOtpEncryptionKey()` returns `undefined` (deprecated)
- [x] API framework only exports JWT encryption functions
- [x] No frontend code actually uses `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- [x] Build system documentation confirms removal
- [x] Mods Hub explicitly removed it from types
- [ ] Root app still has outdated type definition
- [ ] Some documentation still references it

---

## 📝 Conclusion

**You are 100% correct!** `VITE_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` was removed and replaced with JWT-based encryption. The codebase now uses:

- ✓ **JWT tokens** for encryption (per-user, per-session)
- ✗ **NO service key encryption** (removed as obfuscation-only)

The remaining references are:
- Outdated documentation
- Legacy type definitions
- Backward compatibility code paths

**Action Required**: Clean up remaining references and update documentation.
