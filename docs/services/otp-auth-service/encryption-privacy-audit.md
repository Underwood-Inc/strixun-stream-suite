# Encryption & Privacy System - Comprehensive Audit ★ > **Fresh audit of encryption architecture, privacy features, and what's needed for userId (email) double-encryption**

---

## ★ Executive Summary

This audit identifies:
1. ✓ **What exists** - Router encryption, two-stage encryption utilities
2. ✗ **What's missing** - User preferences, data request system, email privacy, userId double-encryption
3. ★ **What needs integration** - Two-stage encryption with router, userId field handling

---

## ✓ What Exists (Current State)

### 1. Router-Level Automatic Encryption ✓ **COMPLETE**

**Location:** `serverless/otp-auth-service/router/admin-routes.ts`, `router/game-routes.js`

**What Works:**
- ✓ Router automatically encrypts ALL responses with requester's JWT
- ✓ Encryption happens in `handleAdminRoute()` and `handleGameRoute()`
- ✓ Uses `encryptWithJWT()` from `utils/jwt-encryption.js`
- ✓ Sets `X-Encrypted: true` header
- ✓ Client automatically decrypts with `decryptWithJWT()` in API client
- ✓ Works for all authenticated routes (admin, game, user routes)

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// router/admin-routes.ts:179-183
if ('jwtToken' in auth && auth.jwtToken && handlerResponse.ok) {
    const { encryptWithJWT } = await import('../utils/jwt-encryption.js');
    const responseData = await handlerResponse.json();
    const encrypted = await encryptWithJWT(responseData, auth.jwtToken);
    // ... returns encrypted response
}
```

**Status:** ✓ **WORKING** - All responses are automatically encrypted with requester's JWT

---

### 2. Two-Stage Encryption Utilities ✓ **COMPLETE**

**Location:** `serverless/otp-auth-service/utils/two-stage-encryption.ts`

**What Works:**
- ✓ `encryptTwoStage()` - Encrypts data with owner's JWT (Stage 1) + request key (Stage 2)
- ✓ `decryptTwoStage()` - Decrypts Stage 2 with request key, then Stage 1 with owner's JWT
- ✓ `generateRequestKey()` - Generates secure request keys
- ✓ `isDoubleEncrypted()` - Checks if data is double-encrypted
- ✓ Proper error handling and key verification
- ✓ Uses PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- ✓ AES-GCM-256 encryption

**Status:** ✓ **COMPLETE** - Utilities exist but NOT integrated into handlers

---

### 3. JWT Encryption Utilities ✓ **COMPLETE**

**Location:** `serverless/otp-auth-service/utils/jwt-encryption.js`

**What Works:**
- ✓ `encryptWithJWT()` - Encrypts data with JWT token
- ✓ `decryptWithJWT()` - Decrypts data with JWT token
- ✓ Token hash verification
- ✓ AES-GCM-256 encryption
- ✓ PBKDF2 key derivation

**Status:** ✓ **WORKING** - Used by router for automatic encryption

---

### 4. Display Name System ✓ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**

**Location:** `serverless/otp-auth-service/services/nameGenerator.ts`, `handlers/user/displayName.js`

**What Works:**
- ✓ Random display name generation
- ✓ Display name uniqueness checking
- ✓ Display name reservation/release
- ✓ Display name validation
- ✓ Display name stored in user object
- ✓ Display name auto-generated on user creation
- ✓ Display name update endpoint (`PUT /user/display-name`)

**What's Missing:**
- ✗ Display name change history tracking
- ✗ Monthly change limit enforcement
- ✗ Display name regeneration endpoint
- ✗ "Previously known as" tooltip support

**Status:** ✓ **PARTIAL** - Core functionality works, history/limits missing

---

### 5. Super Admin System ✓ **COMPLETE**

**Location:** `serverless/otp-auth-service/utils/super-admin.js`

**What Works:**
- ✓ Super admin API key authentication
- ✓ Super admin email list authentication
- ✓ Super admin check in admin routes

**Status:** ✓ **WORKING**

---

## ✗ What's Missing (Required Features)

### 1. userId (Email) Double-Encryption ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Current State:**
- ✗ `userId` field is returned in plain text (single-encrypted by router only)
- ✗ No double-encryption applied to `userId` field
- ✗ No check for user preferences (email visibility)
- ✗ No request system integration

**Where userId is Currently Returned:**
1. `handlers/auth/session.js:76-77` - `GET /auth/me` returns `sub: user.userId, email: user.email`
2. `handlers/admin/customers.js:83` - `GET /admin/customers/me` returns `email: customer.email`
3. `handlers/auth/jwt-creation.ts:133` - Token response includes `email: emailLower`

**What Needs to Be Built:**
- [ ] Check user preferences for `emailVisibility`
- [ ] If `emailVisibility === 'private'`, double-encrypt `userId` field
- [ ] If `emailVisibility === 'public'`, return `userId` single-encrypted (router handles this)
- [ ] Integrate two-stage encryption into response builders
- [ ] Update all handlers that return `userId` or `email` fields

**Architecture:**
```
Handler Response:
{
  id: "req_123...",           // Single-encrypted (router)
  customerId: "cust_abc...",  // Single-encrypted (router)
  userId: {                   // Double-encrypted (if private)
    doubleEncrypted: true,
    stage1: {...},            // Owner's JWT
    stage2: {...}             // Request key
  }
}
    
Router encrypts entire response with requester's JWT
    
Client receives encrypted blob
    
Client decrypts router encryption  gets double-encrypted userId
    
To decrypt userId: Need owner's JWT + approved request key
```

---

### 2. User Preferences System ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Requirements:**
- User preferences storage (email visibility, privacy settings)
- Preferences API endpoints
- Default preferences on user creation

**What Needs to Be Built:**
- [ ] User preferences data structure:
  ```typescript
  interface UserPreferences {
    emailVisibility: 'private' | 'public';  // Default: 'private'
    displayName: {
      current: string;
      previousNames: Array<{
        name: string;
        changedAt: string;
        reason: 'auto-generated' | 'user-changed' | 'regenerated';
      }>;
      lastChangedAt: string | null;
      changeCount: number;
    };
    privacy: {
      showEmail: boolean;
      showProfilePicture: boolean;
    };
  }
  ```
- [ ] Preferences storage in user object (KV: `user_${emailHash}`)
- [ ] `GET /user/me/preferences` endpoint
- [ ] `PUT /user/me/preferences` endpoint
- [ ] Preferences validation
- [ ] Default preferences on user creation

**Status:** ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 3. Sensitive Data Request System ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Requirements:**
- Super admin can create requests for sensitive data
- User (owner) can approve/reject requests
- Request key management
- Request status tracking

**What Needs to Be Built:**
- [ ] Request data structure:
  ```typescript
  interface DataRequest {
    requestId: string;
    requesterId: string;        // Super admin customerId
    targetUserId: string;        // User whose data is requested
    dataType: 'email' | 'userId' | 'custom';
    reason: string;
    status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'expired';
    requestKey?: string;         // Encrypted with requester's JWT when approved
    createdAt: string;
    approvedAt?: string;
    rejectedAt?: string;
    expiresAt: string;
  }
  ```
- [ ] Request storage in KV (`data_request_${requestId}`)
- [ ] `POST /admin/data-requests` - Create request
- [ ] `GET /admin/data-requests` - List requests
- [ ] `GET /admin/data-requests/:id` - Get request details
- [ ] `POST /admin/data-requests/:id/approve` - Approve request (user endpoint)
- [ ] `POST /admin/data-requests/:id/reject` - Reject request (user endpoint)
- [ ] Request key encryption with requester's JWT
- [ ] Request expiration handling

**Status:** ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 4. Email Privacy Filtering ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Requirements:**
- Emails should NOT be rendered unless user makes them public
- Only display name shown by default
- If email is public, show as tooltip on hover over display name

**What Needs to Be Built:**
- [ ] Filter email from API responses if `emailVisibility === 'private'`
- [ ] Return `userId` as double-encrypted object if private
- [ ] Frontend logic to show/hide email based on preference
- [ ] Tooltip component integration for email display
- [ ] Update all handlers that return email/userId

**Status:** ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5. Display Name History & Limits ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Requirements:**
- Track all display name changes
- Show "previously known as" in tooltips
- Enforce monthly change limit (once per month)
- Display name regeneration endpoint

**What Needs to Be Built:**
- [ ] Display name history array in user object
- [ ] Monthly change limit check in `PUT /user/display-name`
- [ ] `POST /user/display-name/regenerate` endpoint
- [ ] Tooltip component for "previously known as"
- [ ] Frontend integration

**Status:** ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

---

## ★ Integration Requirements

### 1. Two-Stage Encryption Integration

**Current State:**
- ✓ Two-stage encryption utilities exist
- ✗ NOT integrated into response builders
- ✗ NOT used in any handlers

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Create response builder utility that:
   - Checks user preferences for `emailVisibility`
   - If private, double-encrypts `userId` field with owner's JWT + request key
   - If public, returns `userId` as normal (router will single-encrypt)
2. Update all handlers that return `userId`/`email`:
   - `handlers/auth/session.js` - `GET /auth/me`
   - `handlers/admin/customers.js` - `GET /admin/customers/me`
   - Any other handlers returning user data

**Challenge:**
- Need owner's JWT token to encrypt Stage 1
- Need request key to encrypt Stage 2 (but requests don't exist yet)
- **Solution:** For initial implementation, use a default request key or generate one per user

---

### 2. Router Encryption + Double-Encryption Flow

**Architecture:**
```
Handler Response:
{
  id: "req_123...",           // Single-encrypted (router)
  customerId: "cust_abc...",  // Single-encrypted (router)
  userId: {                   // Double-encrypted (if private)
    doubleEncrypted: true,
    stage1: {...},            // Owner's JWT
    stage2: {...}             // Request key
  }
}
    
Router encrypts ENTIRE response with requester's JWT
    
Client receives:
{
  version: 3,
  encrypted: true,
  data: "<encrypted_base64>"  // Contains id, customerId, and double-encrypted userId
}
    
Client decrypts router encryption:
{
  id: "req_123...",           // ✓ Available (single-encrypted)
  customerId: "cust_abc...",  // ✓ Available (single-encrypted)
  userId: {                   // ⚠ Still double-encrypted
    doubleEncrypted: true,
    stage1: {...},
    stage2: {...}
  }
}
    
To decrypt userId:
1. Get approved request (has request key encrypted with requester's JWT)
2. Decrypt request key with requester's JWT
3. Decrypt Stage 2 with request key
4. Decrypt Stage 1 with owner's JWT (provided by system)
5. Get: "user@example.com"
```
