## [OK] What Was Created

### **Directory Structure:**
```
serverless/shared/encryption/
├── index.ts                    # Main exports
├── jwt-encryption.ts           # Universal JWT encryption (Workers + browser)
├── multi-stage-encryption.ts  # Multi-party encryption (2-10 parties)

```

### **Integration:**
- [OK] Added exports to `serverless/shared/api/index.ts`
- [OK] Available through `@strixun/api-framework` imports
- [OK] Direct imports from `serverless/shared/encryption/` also available

## [EMOJI] Key Features

### **1. Universal JWT Encryption**
- Works in Cloudflare Workers and browser
- Single source of truth for encryption algorithm
- Backward compatible with existing encrypted data

### **2. Multi-Stage Encryption (NEW! [EMOJI])**
- **Supports 2-10 parties** (all keys required to decrypt)
- **Flexible key types**: JWT tokens, request keys, or custom keys
- **Order-independent decryption**: Can decrypt in ANY order (version 3+)
- **Master key architecture**: Uses parallel encryption for true order independence
- **Backward compatible**: Two-stage encryption still works, version 2 nested encryption supported

### **3. Two-Stage Encryption (Backward Compatible)**
- Special case of multi-stage with exactly 2 parties
- Maintains existing API for backward compatibility
- Can be used alongside multi-stage encryption

### **4. Router Middleware**
- Automatic response encryption when JWT token present
- Easy to integrate into existing routers
- Consistent pattern across all services

---

##  Usage Examples

### **Basic JWT Encryption:**
```typescript
import { encryptWithJWT, decryptWithJWT } from '@strixun/api-framework';

const encrypted = await encryptWithJWT({ secret: 'data' }, jwtToken);
const decrypted = await decryptWithJWT(encrypted, jwtToken);
```

### **Two-Stage Encryption (Backward Compatible):**
```typescript
import { encryptTwoStage, decryptTwoStage } from '@strixun/api-framework';

const encrypted = await encryptTwoStage(data, ownerJWT, requestKey);
const decrypted = await decryptTwoStage(encrypted, ownerJWT, requestKey);
```

### **Multi-Stage Encryption (NEW!):**
```typescript
import { encryptMultiStage, decryptMultiStage } from '@strixun/api-framework';
import type { EncryptionParty } from '@strixun/api-framework';

// Encrypt with 3 parties
const parties: EncryptionParty[] = [
  { id: 'owner', key: ownerJWT, keyType: 'jwt' },
  { id: 'requester', key: requesterJWT, keyType: 'jwt' },
  { id: 'auditor', key: auditorKey, keyType: 'custom' },
];

const encrypted = await encryptMultiStage(data, parties);

// Decrypt (requires ALL parties' keys - order does NOT matter!)
const decrypted = await decryptMultiStage(encrypted, parties);
```

### **Router Middleware:**
```typescript
import { wrapWithEncryption } from '@strixun/api-framework';

async function handleRoute(
  handler: (req: Request, env: Env, auth: AuthResult) => Promise<Response>,
  request: Request,
  env: Env,
  auth: AuthResult
): Promise<RouteResult> {
  const response = await handler(request, env, auth);
  return await wrapWithEncryption(response, auth);
}
```

## [EMOJI] How Multi-Stage Works

### **Encryption Flow:**
```
Data
   [Party1 Encrypt with JWT]
Encrypted Layer 1
   [Party2 Encrypt with Request Key]
Encrypted Layer 2
   [Party3 Encrypt with Custom Key]
Encrypted Layer 3 (Final)
```

### **Decryption Flow:**
```
Encrypted Layer 3 (Final)
   [Party3 Decrypt with Custom Key]
Encrypted Layer 2
   [Party2 Decrypt with Request Key]
Encrypted Layer 1
   [Party1 Decrypt with JWT]
Data
```

**Key Points:**
- All parties must be known at encryption time
- All parties' keys are required for decryption
- Order matters: decryption is reverse of encryption
- Each party can use different key types (JWT, request-key, custom)

## [EMOJI] Design Decisions

### **1. Multi-Stage as Generalization**
- Two-stage is a special case (2 parties)
- Multi-stage supports 2-10 parties
- Same underlying mechanism, just more flexible

### **2. Backward Compatibility**
- Existing two-stage encrypted data still works
- `encryptTwoStage()` and `decryptTwoStage()` maintain same API
- No breaking changes to existing code

### **3. Universal Implementation**
- Single codebase for Workers and browser
- Uses Web Crypto API (available in both)
- No environment-specific code

### **4. Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript support
- Proper interfaces for all data structures
- IDE autocomplete and type checking

## [EMOJI] Next Steps (Migration)

Now that the encryption suite is complete, the next phase is to:

1. **Migrate Services** - Update all services to use shared encryption
2. **Remove Duplicates** - Delete service-specific encryption files
3. **Add Encryption to Missing APIs** - Chat Signaling, URL Shortener, Mods API, User Routes
4. **Test Compatibility** - Verify existing encrypted data still works

---
